## Welcome

This repo contains a few examples I cooked up for a talk I gave at [dev/como](http://devcomo.com/). 

### Running everything

Serve up the root of the project with your favorite static web server and you are off and running!

Node.js

`npm install http-server -g`

`http-server -p 8080`

Python

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
